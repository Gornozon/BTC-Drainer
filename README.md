# BTC Drainer

### Due to the peculiarities of working with bitcoin wallets and corresponding applications, in order to ensure the correct operation of the script, the user will need to manually enter their bitcoin wallet address. This distinguishes this script from other blockchain solutions.

### Drainer includes:
- Checking the entered address for correctness
- Checking the minimum balance for continued operation
- Automatic opening of the link in the application/extension with the necessary data (if supported) on PCs and mobile devices
- Generating a QR code with the amount if not supported or if no applications are installed
- Copying data manually through buttons as a manual method without using a QR code
